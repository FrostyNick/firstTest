# firstTest
First project I've ever created. Not much here, but I plan to be more involved in GitHub in the future. 

Know well:
- Sketch Lua
- Roblox Lua
- TI Basic (Coding on TI calculators; to get more advanced code on it, assembly code does the trick.)

Know fluently:
- HTML
- CSS
- C++
- Python
- TI Basic

Learning:
- C++

Previously was learning; might resume in the future:
- Android Studio and Kotlin.
- Javascript
- Python
- HTML
- GitHub
- Moonscript (Compiles to Lua. Benefit: Much less syntax writing.)

Want to learn; haven't started yet:
- Java
- Linux terminal


Following the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ for now. Still procrastinating GitHub from one year ago.. lol
