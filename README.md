# firstTest
First project I've ever created. There might not be much to show yet, but I plan to be more involved in GitHub in the future. 
Updated on 8-7-2020

Know well:
- Sketch Lua (2016)
- Roblox Lua (2015) - I've abandoned this interest because I want to learn to make *actual* programs that can help the world somewhat. This is where I found my interest in coding.
- TI Basic (2018) - Coding on TI calculators; to get more advanced code on it, assembly code does the trick.

Know fluently:
- HTML (2020)
- CSS (2018)
- C++ (2020)
- Python (2020)
- TI Basic

Now learning:
- C++

Previously was learning; might resume in the future:
- Android Studio and Kotlin.
- Javascript
- Python
- HTML
- GitHub
- Moonscript (Compiles to Lua. Benefit: Much less syntax writing.)

Want to learn; haven't started yet:
- Java
- Linux terminal

Projects to look forward to:
- A program that can automate actions on a computer as well as mobile devices. Might be done with python and scrcpy.
- Make a choice game with UI as a program or web-based. Sounds simple.. maybe it will be once figured out.
- Contributing to stuff on GitHub in general.


Following the tutorial at https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ for now. Still procrastinating GitHub from one year ago.. lol
